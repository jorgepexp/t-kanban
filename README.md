# t-kanban

Platform for managing projects.

## Setup instructions
First, install dependencies in frontend and backend folders
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

_Optional_ The project uses Docker, so if you're using Windows and haven't installed WSL I recommend you to do so

Setup database in backend
```bash
npm run up-db
# or
yarn up-db
```

Run backend
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Explore and edit your data
```bash
npx prisma studio
# or
yarn prisma studio
```

Run frontend
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
